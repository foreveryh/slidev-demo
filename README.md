# Welcome to [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev)!

A presentation slides project configured for Vercel deployment without PDF export functionality.

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Visit <http://localhost:3030> to see your slides.

## üéØ **Core Solution for Vercel Deployment**

The key to successful deployment on Vercel without Playwright is this **critical build script configuration**:

### **Essential Build Script** ‚≠ê
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "slidev build slides.md || (echo 'Slidev build completed with warnings but SPA is ready' && exit 0)"
  }
}
```

### **Why This Works** üîë

- **`||` operator**: Provides fallback when the main build command encounters Playwright errors
- **`exit 0`**: Ensures Vercel sees the build as successful, even with warnings
- **SPA Generation**: The core SPA files are built successfully before the export phase fails

### **Build Process Breakdown**
1. ‚úÖ **SPA Build Phase** - Generates static files successfully
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Export Phase** - Fails due to missing Playwright (expected)
3. ‚úÖ **Fallback Execution** - Continues deployment with success status

## Vercel Deployment Configuration

This project is specifically configured to work on Vercel without requiring Playwright (which has resource limitations on Vercel).

### Key Configuration Changes

#### 1. **Package.json Scripts** (CRITICAL)
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "slidev build slides.md || (echo 'Slidev build completed with warnings but SPA is ready' && exit 0)",
    "dev": "slidev --open"
  }
}
```
- ‚ùå **Removed**: `export` and `start` scripts that would trigger Playwright
- ‚úÖ **Kept**: Only `build` script with fallback strategy
- üöÄ **Key**: `||` operator prevents deployment failure

#### 2. **Vite Configuration (slidev.config.ts)**
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    chunkSizeWarningLimit: 3000,
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          'slidev-theme': ['@slidev/theme-default', '@slidev/theme-seriph'],
          'vue-vendor': ['vue']
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

#### 3. **Frontmatter Settings (slides.md)**
```yaml
---
export: false                       // Disable export in slides
download: false                     // Hide download buttons
---
```

#### 4. **Vercel Configuration (vercel.json)**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

### Why These Changes?

- **Playwright Dependency**: Slidev's export feature requires Playwright for PDF generation
- **Vercel Limitations**: Vercel has resource constraints that prevent Playwright installation
- **Solution**: Configure for web-only deployment (SPA) without export capabilities
- **üöÄ Core Fix**: Use `||` operator in build script to handle Playwright errors gracefully

### Deployment Steps

1. **Push your code** to GitHub
2. **Connect to Vercel** and import your repository
3. **Build settings** will be automatically detected:
   - Build Command: `pnpm build` (default)
   - Output Directory: `dist` (default)
4. **Deploy** - Vercel will build your slides as a static SPA
